Python Guide
A guide repository for anyone who wants to learn python from scratch!

Hello, welcome to the Python guide. The purpose for the project is to provide a
resource to be used as a guide for learning Python. There are many source codes
with different Python concepts that can be checked and followed in your
learning. I decided to share it because one of my goals with the knowledge I
will conquist is to share and help the people enjoy it!

This project has some folders with a specific concept:
* /introduction: Introduction files
* /config:       Guides for Python and IDE configurations
* /guide:        Source files with many Python concepts
* /projects:     Some Python projects made for excercices
* /tests:        Tests to check some Python operation
* /resources:    Files used with Python codes

All of the source are using a underscore '_' as prefix to avoid problems with
module importation. Like the _random.py file that use random module. If the
file name was 'random.py', the 'random' module could not be imported natively

Getting started installing and configuring your IDE, and check the guide
folder to stay on top of Python learning. For IDE I used VSCode, but you can
use other if you want.

You can execute any python file to validate the result returned on terminal
