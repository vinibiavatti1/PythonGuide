Python Guide
A guide repository for anyone who wants to learn python from scratch!

Hello, welcome to the Python Guide. The purpose of this project is to provide a
easy and valuable resource that can be used as a guide for learning Python.

This project contains all explanations of Python syntax, modules, good
concepts, examples and much more, that you can use to learn Python or even to
consult something.

The main goal of this project is to help you to learn and develop with Python.

The project is separated by specific concepts:
* /guide:         Source files with many Python concepts
* /introduction:  Introduction files and project setup
* /projects:      Some example Python projects
* /resources:     Files used to explain input/output examples

Every source file is using an underscore '_' as prefix to avoid problems with
module importation. Like the _random.py file that use random module. If the
file name was 'random.py', the 'random' module could not be imported.

Getting started installing and configuring your IDE, and check the guide
folder to stay on top of Python learning. For IDE I used VSCode, but you can
use other if you want.

You can execute any python file to validate the result returned on terminal.

Have a good learning!
