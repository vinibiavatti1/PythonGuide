Python Setup

* Install Python by downloading it from the official website and following the
  installation instructions.
* We recommend to use the MSI installer for a smooth installation process.
* Some operating systems may already have Python pre-installed. Check your
  system's Python version by running `python --version` in the terminal.
* Reference: https://www.python.org/

Path Environment Variable
* During the installation process, you may be prompted to add Python to your
  system's PATH. Make sure to enable this option.
* After installation, ensure that the Python installation path is added to your
  system's PATH environment variable.
* This allows you to run Python from the command line without specifying the
  full path to the executable.
* You can verify that Python is in your PATH by running `python --version` in a
  new terminal window.
* If Python is not recognized, you can follow the steps below to add it to your
  PATH manually.
