"""
Type class

* Type has't the first letter capitalized, but this is a class, not a function!
* if a single object is passed to type(), the function returns its type
* If three parameters are passed to type(), it returns a new class object
  (type will become a metaclass)
* Type is used as default as metaclass for created classes
* The isinstance() built-in function is recommended for testing the type of an
  object, because it takes subclasses into account

Syntax forms: type(object)
              type(name, bases, dict)

# type(object)
# * In this way, type will just return the datetype of the parameter

print(type_1, type_2, type_3, sep=', ')
# <class 'int'>, <class 'float'>, <class 'str'>
print()


# type(name, bases, dict)
# * The use case for type(name, bases, dict) is when you want to dynamically
#   generate classes at runtime (type as metaclass)
