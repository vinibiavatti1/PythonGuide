    <h1 align="center">Python Guide</h1>
    <p align="center">A guide repository for anyone who wants to learn python from scratch!</p>
</p>

### Purpose
The purpose for the project is to provide a resource to be used as a guide for learning Python. There are many source codes with different Python concepts that can be checked and followed in your learning. I decided to share it because one of my goals with the knowledge I will conquist is to share and help the people enjoy it!

### Guide
You can find many source files with informations and examples of some Python concepts in the guide folder. Sometimes, I will update this project with more information.

### IDE
I used VSCode as IDE to programming in Python, but you can use any IDE you want. It is up to you. In the config folder, I put some files explaining how to configurate VSCode to start with Python, to ensure that the PEP8 will be followed correctly. In the project there is a `.editorconfig` file with some IDE settings to keep the same configurations for your IDE. For this, you must install the `editorconfig` extension in your environment.

```python
def lets_learn_python(answer):
    if answer is True:
        print('So, lets go!')


lets_learn_python(True)  # or of course!
```
