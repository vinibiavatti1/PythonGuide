Compiling vs Interpreting

Compiling
* Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the
  processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient
  to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more
  control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage
* Compiled languages need a build step, they need to be manually compiled first
* You need to rebuild the program every time you need to make a change
* Examples: C, C++, Java

Interpreting
* Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command
* Most command line tools, CLIs, and shells can theoretically be classified as
  interpreted languages
* The code itself is platform independent
* Examples: PHP, Ruby, Python, JavaScript
