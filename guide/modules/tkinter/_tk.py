TK

* The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the
  Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as
  well as on Windows systems. (Tk itself is not part of Python; it is
  maintained at ActiveState
* It is based on TCL/TK developed by John Ousterhout as an extension for the
  Tcl scripting language
* Tkinter was written by Fredrik Lundh
